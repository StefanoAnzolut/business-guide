Signing a document from within Google Drive
===========================================

.. NOTE::
  Before you can sign documents directly from Google Drive, your Google Drive admin has to connect it with Skribble Business. If you don’t see **Skribble – Electronic Signature** after right-clicking on the document you want to sign, please get in touch with the admin.
  
To sign the document from Google Drive:

- **Right-click** on the document that you want to sign

- Click **Open with** (you’ll see Skribble as an option)

- Select **Skribble – Electronic Signature** from the list

- Log in with your Skribble account and sign the document or invite others to sign the usual way

There’s no need to upload the document or download it once it’s signed. Signed documents will be saved automatically in the folder designated by your Google Drive admin.
