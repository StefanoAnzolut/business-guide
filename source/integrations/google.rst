With the Skribble Electronic Signature plug-in, companies, departments, and teams can sign and get documents signed from within their favourite tools.

You can set up the plug-in just for yourself or for the entire company. However, we recommend company-wide implementation, which we describe below. 

To connect Google Drive with Skribble Business, youâ€™ll need:

â€¢	**Google Drive admin access**
â€¢	**Skribble API credentials**
â€¢	**Skribble Electronic Signature plug-in**

We recommend that the Google Drive admin sets up the Skribble Electronic Signature plug-in. Skribble Business admins might not have all the necessary rights to finish the setup.
