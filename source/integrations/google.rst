Skribble integrates easily with Google Drive and enables companies, departments, and teams to sign and get documents signed electronically directly from their favourite tools.

To connect Google Drive and Skribble Business, you’ll need:

•	**Admin access to your company’s Google Drive**
•	**Skribble API credentials**
•	**Skribble Electronic Signature plug-in**

We recommend that the Google Drive admin does the setup of the Skribble Electronic Signature plug-in. Skribble Business admins might not have all the necessary rights to finish the setup on Google Drive.
