Signing from within Google Drive, OneDrive and SharePoint
=========================================================

.. NOTE::
  Before you can sign documents directly from Google Drive, OneDrive or SharePoint, the admin of your company will have to connect them with Skribble Business.

If you don’t see **Skribble – Electronic Signature** after right-clicking on the document you want to sign, please get in touch with the admin of the document management system used in your company.
  
To sign the document:

- Go to **Google Drive, OneDrive or SharePoint** (depends on which one is used in your company)

- **Right-click** on the document that you want to sign

- Click **Open with** (you’ll see Skribble as an option)

- Select **Skribble – Electronic Signature** from the list

- **Log in** with your **Skribble account** and sign the document or invite others to sign the usual way

There’s no need to upload the document or download it once it’s signed. Signed documents will be saved automatically in the folder designated by your Google Drive admin.
