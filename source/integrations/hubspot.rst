Set Up Signing From Hubspot ðŸ†•
==============================

.. NOTE::
 Signing directly from the **Deals section** on Hubspot is possible with a plug-in available to **Skribble Business customers**.

With the Skribble Electronic Signature plug-in, companies, departments, and teams can sign and track their status without leaving Hubspot. To connect Hubspot with Skribble Business, youâ€™ll need:

â€¢	**Hubspot admin access**
â€¢	**Skribble API credentials**
â€¢	**Skribble Electronic Signature plug-in**

We recommend that the Hubspot admin sets up the Skribble Electronic Signature plug-in. Skribble Business admins might not have all the necessary rights to finish the setup.

**Step-by-step guide for Hubspot admins to connect it with Skribble:**

.. NOTE::
 Before starting, make sure you have Skribble API credentials (username and API key) ready. You can get these from your companyâ€™s Skribble Business admin. `Learn more`_.

- Go to `Hubspot App Marketplace`_ to get the plug-in (look for the Marketplace icon in the main navigation of your Hubspot account)

- To allow Skribble to interact with the Deals section, click **Allow**
