Signing documents from Google Drive
===================================

.. NOTE::
  Before you can sign documents from within Google Drive, your Google Drive admin will have to connect it with your company's Skribble Business.

If you don't see **Skribble – Electronic Signature** as an option after right-clicking on the document you want to sign, please get in touch with your Google Drive admin.

To sign from Google Drive:

- Go to `https://drive.google.com/drive`_

.. _https://drive.google.com/drive: https://drive.google.com/drive

If you're not logged in yet, please make sure to log in with the same e-mail address you use to log in to your Skribble account.

- **Right-click** on the document you want to sign

- Click **Open with** 

- Select **Skribble – Electronic Signature** from the list

- **Log in** with your **Skribble account** and sign the document or invite others to sign as usual

Signed documents will be saved automatically in the same folder from which you originally opened them (unless defined otherwise by your Google Drive admin).
