How to sign from Google Drive
=============================

.. NOTE::
  Signing from Google Drive is only available to Skribble Business customers.
  
Has your Google Drive admin connected your company's Skribble Business with Google Drive? Then you can sign with Skribble from your Google Drive Web App.

To sign a document from Google Drive (video tutorial available `here`_):

.. _drive.google.com/drive: https://drive.google.com/drive

- **Right-click** on the document you want to sign

- After all invited parties have signed the document, the signed copy will be saved next to the original document in your Google Drive

You can't find the signed document next to the original document? Check the folder **Signed with Skribble Electronic Signature**. This is where we'll save signed documents if you don't have access rights to the folder where the document is when the last signature is made.
