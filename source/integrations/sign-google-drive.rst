Signing documents from Google Drive
===================================

.. NOTE::
  This feature is available to Skribble Business customers.
  
Once your Google Drive admin has connected your company's Skribble Business with Google Drive, you'll be able to sign with Skribble directly from your Google Drive Web App.

To sign a document from Google Drive (video tutorial available `here`_):

 You don't see the signed document next to the original document? Please check the folder **Signed with Skribble Electronic Signature**. This is where we'll save signed documents if you don't have access rights to the folder where the document is when the last signature is made.
