- Select **Skribble Electronic Signature** and follow the instructions

If you don't see Skribble Electronic Signature after right-clicking on the document, please contact your OneDrive admin.
    
- You'll have to activate signing with Skribble if you're signing for the first time or if you haven't been signing for a long time

- Click **Activate and continue with signing**

- **Log in** with your **Skribble account**

Your Skribble and Microsoft e-mail address must match.

- **Sign** the document or **invite** others to sign the usual way
    
- After all invited parties have signed the document, it will be automatically saved next to the original document.

If you don't see the signed document next to the original, please look for the folder **Signed with Skribble Electronic Signature**. It's located in your personal OneDrive.
