Signing documents from OneDrive and SharePoint
==============================================

.. NOTE::
  This is a beta feature available to a limited group of Skribble Business customers.
  
Once your company's admin has connected OneDrive for Business with Skribble Business, you'll be able to sign directly from **OneDrive** and **SharePoint Online**.

To sign a document:

- Go to `OneDrive`_ or SharePoint Online

.. _OneDrive: https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin

- **Right-click** on the document you want to sign

- Click **Open with**, then select **Skribble Electronic Signature** and follow the instructions

If you don't see Skribble Electronic Signature after right-clicking on the document, please get in touch with your OneDrive for Business admin.
    
- You'll have to activate signing with Skribble if you're signing for the first time

- Click **Activate and continue with signing**

- **Log in** with your **Skribble account** and sign the document or invite others to sign the usual way

Your Skribble and Microsoft e-mail address must match.
    
- After all invited parties have signed the document, it'll automatically be saved next to the original document (provided you have the necessary access rights).

If you don't see the signed document next to the original, you don't have the necessary access rights, and the document couldn't be saved in the original folder. You'll find the document in the folder called **Signed with Skribble Electronic Signature** that is located in your personal OneDrive. 

Signed documents are also available for download in your Skribble account on my.skribble.com.
