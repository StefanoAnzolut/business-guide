You'll need a credit card to set up Skribble Business for your company. However, if you don't have a business credit card, you can pay by invoice. Get in touch with our support team at support@skribble.com to set this up.

.. NOTE::
   You can update your credit card but not remove it. 
   
To update your credit card information:

- Go to your **Business profile**

- Click **Billing** 

- Navigate to **Payment method**

- Then click **Update** to confirm changes
