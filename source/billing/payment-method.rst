Updating Payment Method
=======================
   
Youâ€™ll need a credit card to set up Skribble Business for your company. We won't charge it during the free 30-day trial.

.. NOTE::
  If you want to pay by invoice after the free trial, contact our support team at support@skribble.com. However, we only recommend this if you're sure you'll be using Skribble long-term, as switching to invoice is done manually.

To update your credit card details:

- Click **Skribble Business** in the lower left 

- Go to **Business profile**

- Click **Billing**

- Then go to **Payment method**

- Click the **pencil icon** to update your credit card

- Then click **Update** to save changes
