You'll need a credit card to set up Skribble Business for your company. However, if you don't have a business credit card, please get in touch with our support team at support@skribble.com. We'll change the payment method for your business so you can pay by invoice.

.. NOTE::
   You can update your credit card but not remove it. 
   
To update your credit card information:

- Go to your **Business profile**

- Click **Billing** 

- Navigate to **Payment method**

- Click the **pencil icon** to update your credit card

- Then click **Update** to confirm changes
