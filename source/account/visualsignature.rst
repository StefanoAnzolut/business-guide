Customising Visual Signatures ðŸ†•
================================= 

.. NOTE::
  Skribble Enterprise customers can set a uniform visual signature for all employees to ensure a consistent look and feel across the company. Contact us at info@skribble.com for more information.
   
Visual signatures serve as an optional element and donâ€™t affect the legal weight of the electronic signature. It is up to members to decide whether they want to add the visual signature to a document next to the electronic signature.

**A step-by-step guide for your members to customise their visual signature:**

- Click **Profile** in the lower-left

From here, you can customise the following details:
  - **Name**: Your first and last name
  - **Optional line** and **City**: Optional lines for extra information (e.g. organisation, function or name)
  - **Date**: The date when the document was signed  
  - **QR code**: Leads to the `website`_ that explains the e-signature standards
  - **Claim and label**: "Signed with Skribble.com" claim along with an icon of the e-signature standard used
