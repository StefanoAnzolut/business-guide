As a Business and Enterprise customer, you can customise your members' accounts with the company logo and address. This is a great way to convey trust and reliability to both your employees and customers. It also helps them recognise signing invitations that come from your company. 

Company branding will be displayed:
  - in the header (top-left) of your members' accounts
  - in e-mail notifications and
  - in the sidebar of a document

Below you will find examples of company branding.

- **Account header**

Your company logo replaces the logo of Skribble and is displayed in the header of your members' accounts.
