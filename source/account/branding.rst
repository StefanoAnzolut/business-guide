As an admin, you can customise your members' accounts with the company logo and address. This is a great way to convey trust and reliability to both your employees and customers. Seeing your company logo and address also helps them recognise signing invitations that come from your company. 

Company branding will be displayed:
  - in the header (top-left) of your members' accounts
  - in e-mail notifications and
  - in the sidebar of a document

Below you will find examples of company branding.

- **Account header**

Your company logo replaces the logo of Skribble and is displayed in the header of your members' accounts.
