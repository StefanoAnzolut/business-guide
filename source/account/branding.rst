Adding Company Branding
=======================

.. NOTE::
  To request custom branding, we kindly ask you to contact our team at support@skribble.com. We'll be happy to assist you.

Skribble Business and Enterprise customers can customise their account with company branding (logo and address). Adding your company logo and address is a great way to convey trust and reliability to both your employees and customers. It also helps them recognise that signing invitations come from your company.

Company branding will be displayed:

• in the header (top-left) of every member's account
• in e-mail notifications and 
• the document sidebar

**Below you will find some examples of company branding**

- **Account header**

Your company logo will replace the logo of Skribble and will be displayed in the header of every member's account.

- **E-Mail notifications**

When your employees invite someone to sign with Skribble, the person invited will receive a signing invitation by e-mail. Your company logo will be displayed in the footer of the e-mail along with the company address.
