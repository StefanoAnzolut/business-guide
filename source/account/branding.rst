With the custom branding feature, you can add a company logo to your business account. When you invite internal or external parties to sign a document, your company logo will be displayed on the document and in the e-mail footer. This way, you can convey trust and reliability, and reassure all stakeholders that the signing invitation originates from your organisation. 

.. NOTE::
   To add your company logo to your business account, we kindly ask you to reach out to our team at support@skribble.com. We will be happy to assist you.

Below you will find some company branding examples.
