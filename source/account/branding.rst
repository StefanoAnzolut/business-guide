Adding Company Branding
==============================================

.. NOTE::
   This article describes a feature that is only available to Skribble Enterprise customers.

With the custom branding feature, Skribble Enterprise customers can customise their account with company branding (logo and address) to enhance brand recognition. Company branding will appear in the header of your Business account on the Skribble e-signing platform, in e-mail notifications and the document viewer. This way, you can convey trust and reliability with internal and external stakeholders alike, and reassure them that signing invitations come from your organisation.

To request custom branding for your Business account, we kindly ask you to reach out to our team at **support@skribble.com**. We will be happy to assist you.

**Where will company branding appear?**

- **Account header**

On the Skribble e-signing platform, your company logo will replace the logo of Skribble and will be displayed to the members of your account in the account header.

    - **E-mail notifications**

When members of your account invite someone to sign a document with Skribble, the invitee will receive a signing invitation by e-mail. Your company logo will appear in the footer of the e-mail invitation along with the company address.
