Adding Company Branding
=======================

.. NOTE::
  To request company branding, please contact our team at support@skribble.com. We'll be happy to assist you.

As a Business and Enterprise customer, you can customise your members' accounts with the company logo and address. This is a great way to convey trust and reliability to both your employees and customers. It also helps them recognise signing invitations that come from your company. For more information, please see our `Pricing page`_.

Company branding will be displayed:
  - in the header (top-left) of your members' accounts
  - in e-mail notifications and
  - in the sidebar of a document

Below you will find examples of company branding.

- **Account header**

Your company logo replaces the logo of Skribble and is displayed in the header of your members' accounts.

When you invite someone to sign or when someone signs a document, they receive an e-mail notification. Your company logo will be displayed in the e-mail footer along with the company address.
