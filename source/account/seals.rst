Managing Electronic Seals ðŸ†•
============================

.. NOTE::
   This feature is only available to Enterprise customers. To request an electronic seal for your company, contact your Account executive at Skribble or drop us a message at info@skribble.com.

Electronic seals enable you to sign documents on behalf of your company as a legal and not natural person. After you've requested to use your company's seal on our e-signing platform, we'll set it up for you. Once this is done, you'll see the seal in your Skribble Business. As an admin, you can:

â€¢	**Manage API keys and members** allowed to use the seal
â€¢	**Add an image** as a visual representation of the seal (optional)
â€¢	**Specify the display name** of the seal for your members

To enable your Skribble Business members to seal documents, you will have to unlock the seal for each member.

**Adding members or API keys**

- From your **Business profile**, go to **Seals**

- Click on the **Pencil icon** next to the seal

- Navigate to **API keys** or **Members** and click **Add**

- If you're adding **API keys**, select the key from the list and click **Add**

**Note:** Please be aware that you can only add production keys to use seals. Learn more about API keys `here`_.

.. _here: https://docs.skribble.com/business-admin/api/apicreate.html#

- If you're adding **Members**, enter the memberâ€™s e-mail address and click **Add**

- That's it! The seal is ready to use.

**Removing members or API keys**

- Go to **Seals** and click on the **Pencil icon**

- Navigate to **Members** or **API keys**

- Click on the **X** next to the member or an API key

- Click **Remove** to confirm

**Adding a visual seal (optional)**

.. NOTE::
   A visual seal is optional and doesn't affect its legal validity.

You can upload an image to customise the visual appearance of your seal. It will show on the sealed documents, just like the visual signature.

- Go to **Seals**

- Click on the **Pencil icon** on the right

- Upload your seal image and click **Save**

**Specifying a display name**

We recommend adding a display name (e.g. department, team) for your seal. It will be shown to your members and helps them select the right seal if they use multiple ones.

To add a display name:

- Go to **Seals**

- Click on the **Pencil icon** on the right

- Enter the **Display name** and click **Save** to confirm
