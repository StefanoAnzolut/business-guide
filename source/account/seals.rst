Managing electronic seals
=========================

.. NOTE::
   This feature is only available to Enterprise customers. To request an electronic seal for your company, contact your Account executive at Skribble.

With Skribble, your employees can electronically seal documents on behalf of your company. Electronic seals are avialble directly on my.skribble.com or via API.

Once Skribble has finished the setup of your seal, you'll see it in your Skribble Business. As an admin, you can:

•	Activate the seal (**must be done for every seal**)
•	Manage API keys and members allowed to seal
•	Add a visual seal (optional)
•	Specify a display name for members

Before your members can use the seal, you must activate it by adding at least one member or an API key. Activation is a one-time thing.

**Adding members or API keys**

- From your **Business profile**, go to **Seals**

- Next to the seal you want to activate, click on the **Pencil**

- Navigate to **API keys** or **Members** and click **Add**

- If you're adding **API keys**, select the key from the list and click **Add**

- If you're adding **Members**, enter the e-mail address of the member and click **Add**

- After this, the seal is activated, ad ready to use

**Removing members or API keys**

.. NOTE::
   If you remove a member or an API key, they will no longer be able to use the seal.

- Go to **Seals** and click on the **Pencil**

- Navigate to **Members** or **API keys**

- Click on the **X** next to the member or an API key

- Click **Remove** to confirm

**Visual seals (optional)**

You can upload an image to customise the visual appearance of your seal. It will show on the sealed documents, just like the visual signature. If you decide to omit it, make sure you inform your Skribble Business members accordingly.

- Go to **Seals**

- Click on the **Pencil** on the right

- Upload your seal image and click **Save**

**Display name**

We recommend adding a display name (e.g. department, team) for your seal. It will be shown to your members and helps them select the right seal if they use multiple ones.

To add a display name:

- Go to **Seals**

- Click on the **Pencil** on the right

- Enter the **Display name** and click **Save** to confirm
