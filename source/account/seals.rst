Managing electronic seals
=========================

.. NOTE::
   This feature is only available to Enterprise customers. To request an electronic seal for your company, contact your Account executive at Skribble.

Electronic seals are used to sign documents on behalf of your company as a legal entity. To enable your Skribble Business members to seal documents, you will have to unlock the seal for each member.

After you’ve requested to use your company’s seal on our e-signing platform, we’ll set it up for you. Once this is done, you’ll see the seal in your Skribble Business. As an admin, you will be able to:

•	Activate the seal (must be done for each seal)
•	Manage API keys and members allowed to use the seal
•	Add an image as a visual representation of the seal (optional)
•	Specify the display name of the seal for your members


**Adding members or API keys**

- From your **Business profile**, go to **Seals**

- Next to the seal you want to activate, click on the **Pencil**

- Navigate to **API keys** or **Members** and click **Add**

- If you're adding **API keys**, select the key from the list and click **Add**

- If you're adding **Members**, enter member’s e-mail address and click **Add**

- After this, the seal is ready to use

**Removing members or API keys**

- Go to **Seals** and click on the **Pencil**

- Navigate to **Members** or **API keys**

- Click on the **X** next to the member or an API key

- Click **Remove** to confirm

**Adding a visual seal (optional)**

You can upload an image to customise the visual appearance of your seal. It will show on the sealed documents, just like the visual signature. If you decide to omit it, make sure you inform your Skribble Business members accordingly.

- Go to **Seals**

- Click on the **Pencil** on the right

- Upload your seal image and click **Save**

**Specifying a display name**

We recommend adding a display name (e.g. department, team) for your seal. It will be shown to your members and helps them select the right seal if they use multiple ones.

To add a display name:

- Go to **Seals**

- Click on the **Pencil** on the right

- Enter the **Display name** and click **Save** to confirm
