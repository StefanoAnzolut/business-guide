=================================

.. NOTE::
   This feature is only available to Skribble Enterprise customers.

The signature protocol gives you quick access to the compliance-relevant information about who viewed or signed the document with which e-signature standard. Instead of checking every single document for the information required by your compliance team, you can download a PDF and archive it together with the signed document.

To download a signature protocol:

- Open the document
- Click on the **3 dots** at the top-right
- Click on **Signature protocol**
- **Alternative:** Hover over the document and click on the tooltip **i**. Then click on the **Signature protocol** icon on the right.
- Open the protocol 

Depending on the e-signature standard used and the identification method of the signer, the protocol may contain the following information:

â€¢	Document title
â€¢	Signature request ID
â€¢	Number of signatures
â€¢	Signature status (signed, declined, open)
â€¢	Participants incl. API users
â€¢	Participantâ€™s name, e-mail address, phone number, user ID, and business they belong to
â€¢	Date, time and IP address for every activity (uploaded, viewed, signed, sealed, downloaded, delegated, declined, updated)
â€¢	Visual signature (optional)
â€¢	Signature ID
â€¢	E-signature standard used such as QES and legislation (eIDAS, ZertES)
â€¢	Certificate (subject, serial number, pseudonym, issuer)
