Downloading Signature Protocol ðŸ†•
=================================

.. NOTE::
   This feature is only available to Skribble Enterprise customers.

Think of a signature protocol as a history of the recipients' activities of a signature invitation. Need to know who viewed or signed the document with which e-signature standard or who declined to sign? Instead of logging into your account every time to check the information for each document one by one, you can download the signature protocol as a PDF and file it with the signed copy. This comes in handy for your compliance team or anyone else on your team if they ever need this information.

Hereâ€™s how to download a signature protocol:

- Go to **Documents** and open the document you want
- Click on the **3 dots** at the top-right
- Click on **Signature protocol** to download it
- **Alternative:** Click on the **tooltip i** at the top-right of the document. Then select an **icon** that looks like a document and says **Signature protocol** when you hover over it.
- Open the downloaded signature protocol, and file it with the signed copy of a document if you need
