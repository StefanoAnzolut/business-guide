Attachments to the Final E-Mail
===============================

After all invited parties have signed a document, they receive a final confirmation e-mail. This e-mail contains a link to the signed document. As an admin, you can set if the following documents should also be attached: 

•	**Signed document**
•	**Signature protocol** (for Enterprise customers)

.. NOTE::
   Additionally, You can let your members decide if they want to send these documents with the confirmation e-mail or not. If you do so, they can only say yes or no, but they can't attach only one document, for example.

Here is how it works:

- Click **Settings** on the right in your `Admin area`_

.. _Admin area: https://my.skribble.com/business/settings

- Then navigate to **Attachments to the final e-mail**

- Select the signed document, signature protocol (for Enterprise customers) or both to be attached to the e-mail

- If you also slide the switch below the selected documents to the right, your members will be able to decide themselves when setting up a signature invitation

      •	**Example 1:** Let's say you select both the signed document and signature protocol in your admin settings and slide the switch to the right to let your members decide. In this case, your members can untick the checkbox not to attach these documents to the e-mail. They can't select only one document.
      
      •	**Example 2:** Let's say you select only the signed document and don't slide the switch to the right. In this case, the signed document will be attached to the e-mail. Your members won't be able to change this.
