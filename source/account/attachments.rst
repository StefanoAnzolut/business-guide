Attachments to the Final E-Mail
===============================

After all invited parties have signed a document, they receive a final confirmation e-mail. This e-mail contains a link to the signed document. As an admin, you can set if the following documents should also be attached: 

•	**Signed document**
•	**Signature protocol** (for Enterprise customers)

.. NOTE::
   You can let your members decide if they want to send these documents with the confirmation e-mail. If you do so, they can only say yes or no, but they can't attach only one document, for example.

Here is how it works:

- Click **Settings** on the right in your `Admin area`_

.. _Admin area: https://my.skribble.com/business/settings

- Then navigate to **Attachments to the final e-mail**

- Select the signed document, signature protocol (for Enterprise customers) or both to be attached to the e-mail

- Slide the switch below the selected documents to the right if you want your members to decide when to add attachments 

- When setting up a signature invitation, they'll need to tick the box to attach the documents

      •	**Example 1:** Let's say you select both signed document and signature protocol in your admin settings and tick the box to let your members decide. In this case, your members can decide if they want to send along both documents. They can't choose which ones. 
      
      •	**Example 2:** Let's say you select only the signed document and don't tick the box to let your members decide. In this case, recipients will get the signed document with the confirmation e-mail. Your members won't be able to change this.
