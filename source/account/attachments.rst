Confirmation E-Mail Attachments
===============================

After all invited parties have signed a document, they receive a confirmation e-mail. This e-mail contains a link to the signed document. As an admin, you decide if any of the following documents should also be attached to this e-mail:

•	**Signed document**
•	**Signature protocol** (for Enterprise customers)

.. NOTE::
   You can set this for all documents or let your members decide in each case.

Here is how it works:

- Go to **Settings** in your admin area

- Then navigate to **Attachments to the final e-mail**

- Choose if only the signed document, signature protocol (for Enterprise customers) or both should be attached to the e-mail

- If you want your members to decide, slide the switch you see below the documents to the right. They will see a checkbox when setting up a signature invitation and will be able to decide this for each document.
