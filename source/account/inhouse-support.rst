- Click **Business profile** in the lower left

- Go to **In-house support** and click on the pencil icon

- Add an **e-mail address and a phone number**

**Be aware that your members will see these contact details in the help section of their Skribble profile.**

- Click **Save** to confirm 

**Need help with your member's question?** Contact our support team from your **Business profile** by clicking on **Contact support** in the lower left. Or you can go directly to our  `contact form`_ now.
