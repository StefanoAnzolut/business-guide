Add an in-house support contact (1st level support)
===================================================

.. NOTE::
  Only Skribble Enterprise customers can add in-house support contact for their members. Your members will see these contact details in the help section in their Skribble profile. 

As an admin, you can add an e-mail address and a phone number for your Skribble Business members to contact if they need help. This is a great way to streamline your organization's support and enable your members to contact their trusted support.

To add an in-house support contact:

- Click **Business profile** in the lower left

- Go to **In-house support** and click on the pencil icon

- Add an **e-mail address and a phone number** you want your members to contact if they need help (this can be your in-house first-level support, for example)

- Click **Save** to confirm 

- Your members will see these contact details in the help section in their Skribble profile (if let empty, they will see Skribble support details instead)
