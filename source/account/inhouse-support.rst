Adding an in-house support contact
==================================

.. NOTE::
  Only Skribble Enterprise customers can add in-house support contact for their members. Your members will see these contact details in the help section in their Skribble profile. 

As an admin, you can add an e-mail address and a phone number for your Skribble Business members to contact if they need help. This is a great way to keep track of all support questions and make sure your members can contact their trusted support.

To add an in-house support contact:

- Click **Business profile** in the lower left
- Go to **In-house support** and click on the pencil icon
- Add an **e-mail address and a phone number** you want your members to contact if they need help 
You can add your in-house first-level support, for example. 
- Your members will see these contact details in the help section in their Skribble profile (if let empty, they will see Skribble support details instead)
