To add in-house support as the primary support contact:

- Click **Business profile** in the lower left

- Go to **In-house support** and click on the pencil icon

- Add an **e-mail address and a phone number** that your members can contact if they need help

**Please be aware that your members will see these contact details in the help section of their Skribble profile.**

- Click **Save** to confirm
