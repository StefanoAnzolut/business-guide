.. NOTE::
  Enterprise customers can add a dedicated in-house support contact for their members.

As an admin, you can add an e-mail address and a phone number that your Skribble Business members can contact if they need help. This is a great way to streamline your organization's support and enable your members to contact their trusted support team.

To add in-house support as the primary support contact:

- Click **Business profile** in the lower left

- Go to **In-house support** and click on the pencil icon

- Add an **e-mail address and a phone number**

**Be aware that your members will see these contact details in the help section of their Skribble profile.**

- Click **Save** to confirm 

**Need help with your member's question?** Contact our support team by clicking on **Contact support** in the lower left of your **Business profile**.
