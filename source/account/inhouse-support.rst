Adding an in-house support contact
==================================

.. NOTE::
  Only Skribble Enterprise customers can add an in-house support contact for their members. Your members will see these contact details in the help pane in their Skribble profile. 

As an admin, you can add an e-mail address or a phone number for your Skribble Business members to contact if they need help. This can be your in-house 1st level support, for example. This is a great way to keep track of all support inquiries and make sure your members can contact their trusted support. 

To add an in-house support contact:

- Click **Business profile** in the lower left
- Go to **In-house support** and click on the pencil icon
- Add an **e-mail address and a phone number** you want your members to contact if they need help 
- If let empty, Skribble support details will be shown to your Skribble Business members
