Setting a Document Deletion Period ðŸ†•
=====================================

Is there a standard deletion period for documents in your company? As an admin, you can set a deletion period for your team membersâ€™ documents on Skribble. After this period, their documents will be automatically deleted. The count starts on the day a document is uploaded to Skribble.

Depending on whether your company signs with Skribble or is about to switch to our e-signature solution, the deletion period applies to one of the below cases:

â€¢	**all documents**, no matter whether signed or not â†’ existing and new Business and Enterprise customers
â€¢	**completed documents** (signed, declined or withdrawn) â†’ selected Enterprise customers (:ref:`Learn more<completed-documents>`)

**How do I know which documents are affected in my company?**
Check the description in your `Business profile`_. It tells whether all documents or only completed ones are affected.

**Activating deletion period**

.. NOTE::
   The activation of the deletion period will take 7 days. It doesn't matter whether you activate the deletion period for the first time or reactivate it after some time.

- Click **Business profile** in the lower left
    
- Go to **Deletion period**

- Click **Activate deletion period**

- Choose a deletion period for your team

- Click **Activate** to confirm
    
Have you informed your team members? They may need to download the affected documents before they're deleted.

**Changing deletion period**

Let's say you activated the deletion period some time ago. Now that your company's policy changed, you need to set a new deletion period. From your Business profile:

- Go to **Deletion period**
    
- Click on the **Pen symbol**

- Choose a new deletion period

- Click **Save** to confirm

.. NOTE::
   Documents that have been on Skribble longer than the new deletion period will be deleted the next day. Your team members will only receive one e-mail reminder on the day of deletion.

**Good to know**
   
.. _pending-signatures:

â€¢ **What happens to the pending signatures if a document gets deleted?**

Let's say the deletion period expires before all recipients have signed the document. In that case, pending signature invitations will be automatically cancelled. `Learn more`_

.. _e-mail-reminders:
   
â€¢ **E-mail reminders for your team members**

We usually remind your team members that their documents are about to be deleted:

â€¢ **7 days before the deletion**
â€¢ **on the day of deletion**

**Hint!** Let's say you set the deletion period to 5 days or choose a shorter deletion period than your current one. In that case, your team members might only receive one e-mail reminder on the day of deletion. This will be the case for documents that have been on Skribble longer than the new deletion period.

.. NOTE::
   The information below only applies to Enterprise customers who havenâ€™t activated the deletion period for all documents.
   
**Deletion period for completed documents**

.. _completed-documents:

The deletion period only applies to completed documents (signed, declined or withdrawn) if you haven't activated the deletion period for all documents. The count starts on the day a document is uploaded to Skribble.
