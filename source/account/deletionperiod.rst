Setting a Document Deletion Period
==================================

.. NOTE::
   This feature is only available to Skribble Enterprise customers.

Skribble Business admins can select a uniform document deletion period for all Skribble Business members. After this period, their documents will be automatically deleted from Skribble.

As an admin, you can select a document deletion period for:

•	**all documents** (only available to Enterprise customers who became customers after 17 February 2020)
•	**finalised documents** (documents that have been signed by all parties or declined by at least one person)

To set a document deletion period:

- Click **Business profile** if you're not already there

- Click the pen icon on the right and select the new deletion period from the drop-down menu

You'll be able to choose between 5, 10, 30, 60 and 90 days.

- Click **Save** to confirm

We highly recommend that you inform all employees about the selected deletion period to make sure they can download their documents before they're automatically deleted from Skribble.

**E-mail reminders to download affected documents**

We'll send an e-mail reminder to the affected Skribble Business members one week before the document is deleted. They'll receive another e-mail on the day of deletion.

If the document deletion period is set to **5 days**, they'll only receive one e-mail on the day of deletion.
