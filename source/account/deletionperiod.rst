Setting a Document Deletion Period 🆕
=====================================

Is there a standard deletion period for documents in your company? As an admin, you can activate and set a deletion period for your team members’ documents on Skribble. After this period ends, their documents will be automatically deleted.

Whether your company signs with Skribble or is about to switch to e-signatures, the deletion period applies to one of the below cases:

•	**all documents**, no matter whether they are signed or not – existing and new customers
•	**completed documents**, such as signed, declined, withdrawn – selected Enterprise customers. :ref:`Learn more<completed-documents>`

**How do I know which documents deletion period applies to?** Check the description in your Business profile. It tells whether all or only completed documents are affected.

**What happens to the pending signatures?**

Let's say the deletion period expires before all recipients have signed the document. In that case, pending signature invitations will be automatically cancelled. `Learn more`_

**Tip!** Before you activate the deletion period for your team members, be sure to:

•	Inform them about the deletion period that applies in your company.
•	Remind them to download the affected documents before they're deleted.


**Activating deletion period**

.. NOTE::
   The deletion period starts 7 days after activation. If you change an existing deletion period, the new one applies immediately.

- Click **Business profile** in the lower left
    
- Go to **Deletion period**

- Click **Activate now**

- Choose a deletion period and click **Activate** to confirm
    
Have you informed your team members? They may need to download the affected documents before they're deleted.

**Changing deletion period**

Let's say the deletion period was already activated for some time. Now that your company's policy changed, you need to set a new deletion period. From your Business profile:

- Go to **Deletion period**
    
- Click on the **Pen symbol**

- Choose a new deletion period

- Click **Save** to confirm

The new deletion period applies immediately unless you've picked a shorter period (see the note below).

.. NOTE::
   Documents that have been longer on Skribble than the new deletion period will be deleted the very next day. Your team members will only receive one e-mail reminder on the day of deletion.

**E-mail reminders for your team members**

We'll remind your team members that their documents will be deleted:

• **7 days before they're deleted**
• **on the day of deletion**

Let's say you set the deletion period to **5 days** or choose a **shorter deletion period** than your current one. In that case, your team members will only receive one e-mail on the day of deletion (for documents that have been longer on Skribble than the new deletion period).

.. NOTE::
   The information below is only relevant for Enterprise customers who haven’t activated the deletion period for all documents.

.. _completed-documents:

**Deletion period for completed documents**
   
The deletion period only applies to completed documents, such as signed, declined or withdrawn. It starts on the day a document is uploaded to Skribble.

- Go to **Deletion period** 
- Click on the **Pen symbol**
- Choose a new deletion period
- Click **Save** to confirm

It may take a few minutes until the new deletion period shows in your profile.
