Setting a Document Deletion Period ðŸ†•
=====================================

Is there a standard deletion period for documents in your company? As an admin, you can activate and set a deletion period for your team membersâ€™ documents on Skribble. After this period ends, their documents will be automatically deleted. The count starts on the day a document is uploaded to Skribble.

Whether your company signs with Skribble or is about to switch to e-signatures, the deletion period applies to one of the below cases:

â€¢	**all documents**, no matter whether they are signed or not â€“ existing and new customers
â€¢	**completed documents**, such as signed, declined, withdrawn â€“ selected Enterprise customers. :ref:`Learn more<completed-documents>`

**Goog to know** 

**How do I know which documents deletion period applies to?**
Check the description in your Business profile. It tells whether all or only completed documents are affected.

**What happens to the pending signatures if a document gets deleted?**
Let's say the deletion period expires before all recipients have signed the document. In that case, pending signature invitations will be automatically cancelled. `Learn more`_

**Tip!** Before you activate the deletion period for your team members, be sure to:

â€¢	Inform them about the deletion period that applies in your company.
â€¢	Remind them to download the affected documents before they're deleted.


**Activating deletion period**

.. NOTE::
   The deletion period starts 7 days after activation. If you change an existing deletion period, the new one applies immediately.

- Click **Business profile** in the lower left
    
- Go to **Deletion period**

- Click **Activate now**

- Choose a deletion period

- Click **Activate** to confirm
    
Have you informed your team members? They may need to download the affected documents before they're deleted.

**Changing deletion period**

Let's say you activated the deletion period some time ago. Now that your company's policy changed, you need to set a new deletion period. From your Business profile:

- Go to **Deletion period**
    
- Click on the **Pen symbol**

- Choose a new deletion period

- Click **Save** to confirm

The new deletion period applies as of now unless you've picked a shorter one (see note below).

.. NOTE::
   Documents that have been longer on Skribble than the new deletion period will be deleted the very next day. Your team members will only receive one e-mail reminder on the day of deletion.

**E-mail reminders for your team members**

We'll remind your team members that their documents will be deleted:

â€¢ **7 days before the deletion**
â€¢ **on the day of deletion**

.. NOTE::
   The information below only applies to Enterprise customers who havenâ€™t activated the deletion period for all documents.

.. _completed-documents:

**Deletion period for completed documents**
   
The deletion period only applies to completed documents, such as signed, declined or withdrawn, if you haven't activated the deletion period for all documents. The count starts on the day a document is uploaded to Skribble.
