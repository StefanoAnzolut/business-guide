Setting a Document Deletion Period ðŸ†•
=====================================

Is there a standard deletion period for documents in your company? As an admin, you can activate and set a deletion period for your team membersâ€™ documents on Skribble. After this period ends, their documents will be automatically deleted.

Whether your company uses Skribble or is about to switch to e-signatures, the deletion period applies to one of the below:

â€¢	**all documents** (whether theyâ€™re signed or not) â€“ existing and new customers
â€¢	**completed documents only** (signed, declined, withdrawn) â€“ some Enterprise customers. :ref:`Learn more<completed-documents>`

**How do I know which documents are affected?** Youâ€™ll find this information in your Business profile.

**Tip!** Before you activate the deletion period for your team, be sure to:

â€¢	Inform your team members about the deletion period.
â€¢	Remind them to download any affected documents before they're deleted.


**Activating deletion period**

.. NOTE::
   The deletion period for your company starts 7 days after you activate it.

- Click **Business profile** in the lower left
    
- Go to **Deletion period**

- Click **Activate now**

- Choose a deletion period and click **Activate** to confirm
    
Have you informed your team members yet? They may need to download the affected documents before they're deleted.

**Changing deletion period**

Let's say the deletion period has been activated for some time. Now that your company's policy changed, you need to set a new deletion period for your team. You can do this in your Business profile:

- Go to **Deletion period**
    
- Click on the **Pen symbol**

- Choose a new deletion period

- Click **Save** to confirm

The new deletion period is valid immediately unless you've picked a shorter period (see the note below).

.. NOTE::
   Documents that are older than the new deletion period will be deleted the very next day. Your team members will only receive one e-mail reminder on the day of deletion. Be sure to inform your team members about it.

**What happens to the pending signatures?**

Let's say the deletion period expires before all recipients have signed the document. In that case, the pending signature invitations will be automatically cancelled. `Learn more`_

**E-mail reminders for your team members**

We'll remind your team members to download the affected documents:

â€¢ **7 days before they're deleted**
â€¢ **on the day of deletion**

If your set the document deletion period to **5 days** or choose a **shorter deletion period** than the current one, your team members will only receive one e-mail on the **day of deletion**.

.. _completed-documents:

**Deletion period for completed documents**

.. NOTE::
   This information is only relevant for Enterprise customers who havenâ€™t yet activated the deletion period for all documents.
   
The deletion period only applies to completed (signed, declined, withdrawn) documents. It starts on the day the document is uploaded to Skribble.
