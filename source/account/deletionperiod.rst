Setting a Document Deletion Period
==================================

As an admin, you can set a deletion period for your team members’ documents. After their documents have been on Skribble for a while, they will be automatically deleted. We start counting on the day documents are uploaded to Skribble.

Whether your company signs with Skribble or is about to switch to our e-signature solution, the deletion period applies to one of the below cases:

•	**all documents**, no matter whether signed or not → existing and new Business and Enterprise customers
•	**completed documents only** (signed, declined or withdrawn) → selected Enterprise customers (:ref:`Learn more<completed-documents>`)

**How do I know which documents are affected in my company?**
Check the description under `Settings`_ in your Business profile. It tells whether all documents or only completed ones are affected.

.. _Settings: https://my.skribble.com/business/settings

**Tip!** Before you activate the deletion period for your team members, be sure to:

•	Remind them to download the affected documents if they need them.

.. _pending-signatures:

• **What happens to the pending signatures if a document gets deleted?**

Let's say the deletion period expires before all recipients have signed the document. In that case, pending signature invitations will be automatically cancelled. `Learn more`_

.. _e-mail-reminders:

• **E-mail reminders for your team members**

We usually remind your team members that their documents are about to be deleted:

• **7 days before the deletion**
• **on the day of deletion**

**Good to know!** Let's say you set the deletion period to 5 days or choose a shorter deletion period than your current one. In that case, your team members might only get one e-mail reminder on the day of deletion. This will apply to documents that have been on Skribble longer than the new deletion period.

**Questions or need a hand?** Write us a message at support@skribble.com. We'll be happy to help.
   
   
• **Shortening deletion period**
 
If you shorten your current deletion period, your team members might only get one e-mail reminder on the day of deletion. This will be the case for documents that have been on Skribble longer than the new deletion period set.
