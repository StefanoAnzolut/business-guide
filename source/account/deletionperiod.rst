Setting a Document Deletion Period ðŸ†•
=====================================

Is there a standard deletion period for documents in your company? As an admin, you can activate and set a deletion period for your team membersâ€™ documents on Skribble. After this period ends, their documents will be automatically deleted.

Whether your company uses Skribble or is about to switch to e-signatures, the deletion period applies to one of the below:

â€¢	**all documents** (whether theyâ€™re signed or not) â€“ existing and new customers
â€¢	**completed documents only** (signed, declined, withdrawn) â€“ some Enterprise customers. [Learn more](#deletion-period-for-completed-documents)

**Questions or need a hand?** Write us a message at support@skribble.com. We'll be happy to help.

**How do I know which documents are affected in my company?** Youâ€™ll find this information in your Business profile.

**Tip!** Before you activate the deletion period for your team, be sure to:

â€¢	Inform your team members about the chosen deletion period.
â€¢	Remind them to download their documents before they're deleted.


**Activating deletion period**

.. NOTE::
   Youâ€™ll have 7 days to inform your team before the deletion period is activated.

Here's how it works:

- Click **Business profile** in the lower left
    
- Go to **Deletion period**

- Click **Activate now**

- Choose a deletion period and click **Activate** to confirm
    
Did you inform your team members yet? They may need to download the affected documents before they're deleted.

**Changing deletion period**

.. NOTE::
   Is the new deletion period shorter than the one you had before? Be sure to inform your team members. Documents that are older than the new period will be deleted the very next day. Your team members will only receive one e-mail reminder on the day of deletion.

Let's say the deletion period has been activated for some time. Now that your company's policy changed, you need to set a new deletion period for your team. You can do this in your Business profile:

- Go to **Deletion period**
    
- Click on the **Pen symbol**

- Choose a new deletion period

- Click **Save** to confirm

The new deletion period is valid immediately unless you've picked a shorter period (see the note above).

**What happens to the pending signatures?**

Let's say the deletion period expires before all recipients have signed the document. In that case, the pending signature invitations will be automatically cancelled. `Learn more`_

**E-mail reminders for your team members**

We'll remind your team members to download the affected documents:

â€¢ **7 days before they're deleted**
â€¢ **on the day of deletion**

If your set the document deletion period to **5 days or choose a shorter period than your current one**, your team members will only receive **one e-mail on the day of deletion**.

#deletion-period-for-completed-documents

.. NOTE::
   This information is only relevant for some of our Enterprise customers who havenâ€™t yet activated the deletion period for all documents.
   
The deletion period only applies to completed (signed, declined, withdrawn) documents. It starts on the day the document is uploaded to Skribble. Would you like to introduce the deletion period for all documents? Write us a message at support@skribble.com.

**Setting or changing deletion period**

By default, the deletion period is set to 30 days. You can set a deletion period that better fits your company in a few easy steps. From your Business profile:

- Go to **Deletion period** 
- Click on the **Pen symbol**
- Choose a new deletion period
- Click **Save** to confirm

It may take a few minutes until the new deletion period shows in your profile.
