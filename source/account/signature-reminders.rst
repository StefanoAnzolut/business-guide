Signature Reminders
===================

Your team no longer needs to follow up on pending signatures. As an admin, you can activate signature reminders for them, and we’ll send them by e-mail to everyone who hasn’t signed. Be sure to inform your team before activating signature reminders.
  
.. NOTE::
  We’ll start counting on the day the document is uploaded and not the day the signature invitation is sent.
  
To activate signature reminders for your Skribble Business members:

- Click **Business profile** in the lower-left and go to **Signature reminders**

- Click **Get started**

- Choose **how often** reminders should be sent, and click **Save** to confirm

.. NOTE::
  Is there a document deletion period set for your team? Keep in mind that no reminders are sent for deleted documents. Let’s say the deletion period is set to 5 days. If you choose to send signature reminders every 3 days, only 1 reminder is sent.
