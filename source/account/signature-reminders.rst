Activating Signature Reminders
==============================

Your team no longer needs to follow up on pending signatures manually. As an admin, you can activate signature reminders, and we’ll send an e-mail to everyone who hasn’t signed. Be sure to inform your team if you decide to activate reminders for them.
  
.. NOTE::
  We’ll start counting on the day the document is uploaded, not the day the signature invitation is sent.
  
To activate signature reminders for your Skribble Business members:

- Click **Business profile** in the lower-left

- Go to **Signature reminders** and click **Get started**

- Choose the **frequency** (every 3 days, weekly or every 2 weeks)

- Click **Save** to confirm

**Example:** Let’s say you want to send a signature reminder weekly. Here is how it looks like:

•	1st reminder – 7 days after the document is uploaded
•	2nd reminder – 14 days after the document is uploaded
•	3rd reminder – 21 days after the document is uploaded, and so on.


.. NOTE::
  Is there a `document deletion period`_. set for your team? Keep in mind that no reminders are sent for deleted documents. Let’s say the deletion period is 5 days. If you choose to send signature reminders every 3 days, only 1 reminder is sent.
