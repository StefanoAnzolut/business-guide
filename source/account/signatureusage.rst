  Signature reports will show all Skribble Business members regardless of whether they've signed or not.

**Understanding the signature report**

The CSV document will contain the following information:
  - **User** – member's e-mail address or an API
  - **Cost centre** –  cost centre within your organisation (available only to Skribble Enterprise customers with an active single sign-on). If not specified, this column will be left empty.
  - **Self SES, AES and QES** – number of signatures made by members
  - **Invited SES, AES and QES** – number of signatures made by people who were invited to sign by your Skribble Business members

.. NOTE::
  Would you like to assign a cost centre to a member of your business and display it in a CSV? Please contact our team at support@skribble.com. We will be happy to help.
