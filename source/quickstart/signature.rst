Customising Visual Signatures
=============================


Skribble Enterprise and Business customers can customise the appearance of their visual signature to suit individual needs. When signing documents with Skribble, the personal visual signature can be added to a document in addition to the electronic signature. 


To customise your visual signature, you will have to switch to My Skribble first.

From your Skribble Business dashboard:

- Click the **My Skribble** icon in the lower-left

- Go to **Visual signature**

From here, you can customise the following details:
  - **Name**: Your first and last name
  - **Optional line** and **City**: Optional lines for any additional information (e.g. organisation, function or name)
  - **Date**: The date when the document was signed
  
  *Available to Skribble Enterprise and Business customers only:*
  
  - **QR code**: Leads to the `website`_ that briefly explains the e-signature standards
  - **Claim and label**: "Signed with Skribble.com" claim along with an icon of the e-signature standard used
