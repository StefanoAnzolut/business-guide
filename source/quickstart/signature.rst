With Skribble, you can keep the look and feel of your handwritten signature when signing electronically. The visual signature customiser allows you to create your personal visual signature and customise its appearance. When you sign a document with Skribble, your visual signature will be displayed on the signed document.

To customise your personal visual signature, you will have to switch to My Skribble first:

- From your Skribble Business dashboard, click the **My Skribble** icon in the lower left of the menu

**Tip**: For optimal resolution, we recommend that you write your signature on a sheet of A4 paper in the ratio of 1:4 and scan it with your scanner.

  - **Optional line** and **City**: Optional fields for any additional information (e.g. organisation, function or name)
  - **Date**: Date when the document was signed
  - **QR code**: Contains additional information about the e-signature standards
