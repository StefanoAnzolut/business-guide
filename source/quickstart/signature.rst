With Skribble, you can keep the look and feel of your handwritten signature when signing electronically.

When you sign a document with Skribble, your visual signature will be displayed on the signed document.

To customise your personal visual signature:

- From your Skribble Business dashboard, click the **My Skribble** icon in the lower left of the menu first

**Tip:** If you log in to your Skribble account via smartphone, you can directly take a picture of your signature via smartphone camera.

From here, you can customise the following information displayed in your visual signature:

  - **Name**: Your first and last name
  - **Optional line** and **City**: You can fill these two optional lines with any information (e.g. organisation, function or name) that works best for you.
  - **Date**: Date when the document was signed
  - **QR code**: Contains additional information about the e-signature standards
  - **Clam and label**: "Signed with Skribble.com" claim along with the e-signature standard used
