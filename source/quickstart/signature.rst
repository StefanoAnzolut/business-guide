Customising Visual Signatures
=============================


With Skribble, you can keep the look and feel of your handwritten signature when signing electronically. The visual signature customiser allows you to create your personal visual signature and customise its appearance to your needs. When signing documents with Skribble, you can place your visual signature on a document in addition to your electronic signature. 

To customise your visual signature, you will have to switch to My Skribble first. From your Skribble Business dashboard:

- Click the **My Skribble** icon in the lower-left

- Click **Visual signature**

From here, you can customise the following details:
  - **Name**: Your first and last name
  - **Optional line** and **City**: Optional fields for any additional information (e.g. organisation, function or name)
  - **Date**: Date when the document was signed
  - **QR code**: Leads to the `website`_ briefly explaining the e-signature standards *(available to Skribble Enterprise and Business customers only)*
  - **Claim and label**: "Signed with Skribble.com" claim along with an icon of the e-signature standard used *(available to Skribble Enterprise and Business customers only)*
