Now that you’ve set up Skribble Business for your company, we recommend that you start by adding your team members so that they can also sign electronically. Here’s a quick guide on how to do it.

- **Having team members’ identities verified**

Your team members will need to verify their identities to sign documents electronically. Skribble offers various identification methods depending on your individual use case and the e-signature standard required.

**Advanced electronic signature (AES)**

Your team members will need a mobile number or a verified company e-mail address to sign with AES.

  - **Mobile phone number**
  
Anyone with a mobile phone can sign with AES without further identification.

 - **Verified company e-mail address**
  
Registering your company e-mail domain with Skribble will enable your entire company to sign with AES. Anyone who creates a Skribble account with a company e-mail address and is a member of your Skribble Business will be able to sign with the AES right away.  `Learn more about AES for Business`_.

**Qualified electronic signature (QES)**

To sign documents with the QES, your team members can choose between the identification via video call, mobile app and face-to-face on site (if you're based in Switzerland).
   
   
- **Face-to-face**
   
You can choose between 2 options:

- Your team members can make appointments at our partner locations to verify their identity.

- To verify your entire team, our staff can come to your office and train one person. They can then verify everyone else in your team. 

Do you plan to add new members to your Skribble Business regularly? In this case, we recommend one-time training for one employee. After the training, they can verify other employees, customers, or suppliers independently using Swisscom's RA app. `Learn more about how it works`_.

- **Live video call or mobile app**

Identification via live video call or mobile app allows employees in your company to verify their identity online from their Skribble account. It takes less than 5 minutes and can be done anytime, anywhere.

After successful identification, your team members will be ready to sign with QES under EU law, Swiss law, or both.
