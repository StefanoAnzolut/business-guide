Now that you’ve set up Skribble Business for your company, we recommend that you start with adding your team members to enable them to sign electronically. Here’s a quick guide on how to do it.

- **Adding team members to Skribble Business**

You can add your team members by:

- Adding each team member individually by e-mail (`Learn more in this guide`_) or by

- **Having team members’ identities verified**

Your team members will need to verify their identities to sign documents electronically. Skribble offers various identification methods depending on your individual use case and the e-signature standard required.

**Advanced electronic signature (AES)**

Your team members will need a mobile number or a verified company e-mail address to sign with AES.

  - **Mobile phone number**
  
Anyone with a mobile phone number can sign with AES without any further identification.

 - **Verified company e-mail address**
  
Registering your company e-mail domain with Skribble will enable your entire company to sign with AES. Anyone who creates a Skribble account using a company e-mail address and is a member of your Skribble Business will be able to sign with AES right away. `Learn more about AES for Business`_.

**Qualified electronic signature (QES)**

To sign documents with the QES, your team members can choose between `face-to-face identification`_ or identification via `video call`_ (to sign under EU law).

- **Face-to-face**
   
You can choose between 2 options:

- Your team members can make an appointment at one of our partner locations to verify their identity.

- To verify your entire team, our staff can come to your office and train one person. They can then verify everyone else in your team. 

Do you plan to add new members to your Skribble Business regularly? We recommend a one-time training for one employee in this case. After the training, they will be able to verify other employees, customers, or even suppliers independently using the RA app of Swisscom. `Learn more about how it works`_.

- **Via video call** (to sign under EU law only)

Video identification allows employees in your company to do the identity check online. It takes less than 5 minutes and can be done anytime, anywhere. `Learn more about video identification here`_ (in German only).

After successful identification, your team members will be ready to sign with QES under EU law.


.. NOTE::
   Video identification is only permitted for signing with the qualified electronic signature (QES) under EU law. If you want to sign with QES under Swiss law, you'll need to go through a `face-to-face identification offered at our partner locations`_ in Switzerland.
