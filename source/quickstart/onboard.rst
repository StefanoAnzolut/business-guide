Now that you’ve set up Skribble Business for your company, we recommend that you start with adding your team members to enable them to sign electronically. Here’s a quick guide on how to do it.

- **Adding team members to Skribble Business**

You can add your team members by:

- Adding your company domain (`Click here for guidance`_) or by

- Adding each team member individually by e-mail (`Learn more in this guide`_)

- **Having team members’ identities verified**

To sign documents electronically, employees in your company will need to verify their identities. Skribble offers various identification options depending on your individual use case and the e-signature standard required.

.. NOTE::
   You might find it helpful to consult our `e-signature standards page`_ for more information.

**Advanced electronic signature (AES)**

To sign with AES, employees in your company will need a mobile number or company e-mail address.

 - **Company e-mail address**
  
Registering your company domain with Skribble will enable your entire company to sign with AES. Anyone who creates a Skribble account using an e-mail address of your company and is a member of your Skribble Business will be able to sign with AES. `Learn more about AES for Business`_.

  - **Mobile phone number**
  
Anyone with a mobile phone number can sign immediately with AES.
   
   
**Qualified electronic signature (QES)**

To sign documents with the QES, your team members can choose between `face-to-face`_ or identification via `video call`_ (for signing according to EU law).

- **Face-to-face**
   
You can choose between 2 options:

- Anyone can make an appointment at one of our locations to verify their identity.

- To verify your entire team, our staff can come to your office and train one person. They can then verify everyone else in your team. 

Do you plan to add new employees to your Skribble Business regularly? We recommend a one-time training for one employee in your company in this case. After the training, this employee will be able to verify the identity of other employees, customers, or even suppliers independently using the ID app of Swisscom. `Learn more about how it works`_.

- **Via video call** (available for signing according to EU law only)

Video identification allows employees in your company to do the identity check online via their computer or smartphone. It takes less than 5 minutes and can be done anytime, anywhere. `Learn more about video identification here`_ (in German only).

 .. _Learn more about video identification here: https://www.videoident.me/ch/de/

After successful identity verification, your team members will be ready to sign electronically with QES according to EU law.


.. NOTE::
   Video identification is only permitted for signing with the qualified electronic signature (QES) under EU law. If you want to sign with QES under Swiss law, you'll need to go through a `personal verification offered at various locations`_ in Switzerland.
