Starting a Free 30-day Trial
============================

We offer a free trial month to new customers. You don’t need a credit card to get started and test Skribble together with your team.  

Good to know before you get started:

  - **No credit card needed, no strings attached**
  
You don’t need a credit card to start your free trial. However, if you want your team to keep using Skribble after the trial ends, you’ll need to upgrade to the paid plan by adding your payment details. If you’re not sure if you want to keep using Skribble, we recommend that you add your payment details after the trial is over. It’s also up to you to decide if you want to pay by credit card or SEPA Direct Debit.

  - **What happens after the trial ends?**
  
If you add your payment details before the trial ends, you’ll switch to the paid plan directly and your payment method will be charged with the monthly or yearly fee. If not, your trial will end after 30 days, and your team will no longer be able to sign with Skribble.

  - **50 signatures are on us**
  
Your free trial includes 50 signatures. You can use these to sign documents yourself or invite others to sign. If you upgrade to the paid plan before your free trial ends, any unused signatures will expire.
