============================
Starting a Free 30-day Trial
============================

We offer a free trial month to new customers. You don't need a credit card to get started, and you won't be charged during the free trial. Cancelling is also possible at any time during the trial.

Good to know before you get started:

  - **No credit card needed, no strings attached**
  
You don't need a credit card to start your free trial. However, if you want your team to keep using Skribble after the trial ends, you'll need to upgrade to the paid plan by adding your payment details. You can choose between a credit card and SEPA Direct Debit.

  - **Cancel at any time**
  
You only need to cancel your trial if you've added your payment details and no longer want to use Skribble. Skribble Business will continue to run automatically after the trial ends if you don't cancel. Your payment method will be charged with the monthly or yearly fee.

  - **50 signatures are on us**
  
Your free trial includes 50 signatures. You can use these to sign documents yourself or invite others to sign.

Cancelling Free Trial
---------------------

.. NOTE::
  You only need to cancel your trial if you've already added a payment method but no longer want to use Skribble. Cancelling will delete Skribble Business and transfer your members to the free plan. After that, they'll be able to download and save their documents if they need to.

To cancel your free trial:

- Click **Business profile** and go to **Billing**
  
- Navigate to **Current plan** and click the **pencil** icon

- Click **Cancel free trial**
    
- Click **Cancel** to confirm that you really want to cancel the trial and delete Skribble Business
