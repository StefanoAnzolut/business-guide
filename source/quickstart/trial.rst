Starting a Free 14-day Trial
============================

We offer a free 14-day trial to new customers. So, you don’t need a credit card to get started and test Skribble together with your team.  

Good to know before you get started:

  - **No credit card needed, no strings attached**
  
You don’t need a credit card to start your free trial. However, if you want your team to keep signing with Skribble after the trial ends, you’ll need to upgrade to the paid plan by adding your payment details. It’s also up to you to decide if you want to pay by credit card or SEPA Direct Debit.

  - **What happens after the trial ends?**
  
Let’s say you add your payment details before the trial ends. By doing so, you’ll switch to the paid plan directly and allow us to charge your payment method with the monthly or yearly fee. If not, your trial will end after 14 days, and your team will no longer be able to sign with Skribble.

  - **50 signatures are on us during the trial**
  
Your free trial includes 50 signatures. You can use these to sign documents yourself or invite others to sign. Any remaining signatures will expire if you upgrade to the paid plan before your trial ends.

Would you like to test Skribble for free for 14 days? Follow `this guide`_ to get started.
