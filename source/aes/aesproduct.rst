AES for Business: Description
=============================

With AES for Business, your company domain (e.g. yourcompany.com) enables signing with the advanced electronic signature (AES). Anyone who creates a new Skribble account using your company domain (e.g. jsmith@yourcompany.com) and is a member of your Skribble Business can sign with AES without any further action.

**This provides several benefits:**

•	When your employees create a Skribble account, they will automatically be signing at the AES level.

•	Users personal phone number will not be shown in the certificate since their company e-mail provides their identification.

•	Users can sign at the AES level without having a Swiss phone number.
