Adding Members to your Skribble Business
========================================

There are two ways to add members to your Skribble Business:

- By domain 
- By e-mail

The simplest way to add members to your Skribble Business is by registering your company domain (@example.org) with Skribble. Once done, anyone who creates a **new** Skribble account using your company domain will become a member of your Skribble Business.

.. NOTE::
  Employees of your company who created a Skribble account *before* you registered the domain will not be added automatically to your account. You will need to add them by e-mail. Please see Adding members by e-mail, described below.
  
Adding members by domain
-------------------------

- Click **Members** if you aren't already there

- Click **Domains**

- Click **Add domain**

- Enter the domain and click **Add**

We'll automatically check whether the domain belongs to you company and activate it instantly if no manual check is needed.

- After adding a domain, you'll find its status next to the domain name:

  •	**Activated** — your domain has been activated
  •	**Requested** — we'll check the domain manually and inform you once it's done (**Note: this can take up to 48 hours**)
  •	**Declined** — the domain you added couldn't be activated

Adding members by e-mail
-------------------------

The other way to add members to your Skribble Business is by e-mail:

.. NOTE::
   The person must already have a Skribble account before they can be added to your Skribble Business.

- Click **Members** if you aren't already there

- Click **Add Member**

- Enter the e-mail address of the person you wish to add to your Skribble Business and click **Add** once your'e finished

To add several e-mails at once, separate them with a comma. 

If the recipient has a Skribble account, they're now added to your Skribble Business.
