Searching Members
=================

There are two ways to add members to your Skribble Business:

- By domain 
- By e-mail

The simplest way to add members is by registering your company domain (@company.com) with Skribble. Employees who create a **new Skribble account** using your company domain will automatically become your Skribble Business members.

.. NOTE::
  If an employee created a Skribble account *before* the domain was registered, you'll need to add them to your Skribble Business by e-mail. Please see *Adding members by e-mail*, described below.
  
Adding members by domain
-------------------------

- Click **Members**

- Go to **Domains**

- Click **Add domain**

- Enter the domain and click **Add**

We'll activate your domain once we've checked that it belongs to your company. You'll find the current status of the added domain next to its name:

  •	**Activated** — your domain is active
  •	**Requested** — we'll need to check the domain manually (**this can take up to 48 hours**)
  
We'll inform you by e-mail once it's done.
